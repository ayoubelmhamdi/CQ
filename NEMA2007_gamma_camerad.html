<p>This is a summary of a document that tells you how to check how well gamma cameras work. Gamma cameras are machines that make pictures of the inside of your body using a special kind of medicine that gives off radiation.</p>
<p>This document was made by a group of people who work with electrical products. They agreed on what to write in this document, but they may not have checked everything carefully. And they may not agree on everything else.</p>
<p>This document is one of many documents made by NEMA. NEMA is an organization that makes rules and guidelines for electrical products. NEMA does not write the documents or test them. It only helps the people who make them and makes sure they are fair.</p>
<h1 id="what-this-document-covers"><a class="header" href="#what-this-document-covers">What This Document Covers</a></h1>
<p>This text is a guide for checking different kinds of gamma cameras. Gamma cameras are machines that can take pictures of radioactive stuff inside the body. Some of the things to check are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How clear and sharp the pictures are</li>
<li>How well the pictures show where the stuff is</li>
<li>How well the machine can tell apart different kinds of radiation</li>
<li>How even the machine sees radiation in the whole picture</li>
<li>How fast the machine can make pictures</li>
<li>How much radiation the machine can see</li>
<li>How good the machine is at blocking radiation that it does not need</li>
<li>How well the parts of the machine work together</li>
<li>How well the machine can make 3D pictures</li>
</ul>
<p>The kinds of gamma cameras in this guide are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machines with one detector and one crystal that can make flat pictures</li>
<li>Machines with one detector and one crystal that can make curved pictures</li>
<li>Machines with more than one detector that can make flat or curved pictures</li>
<li>Machines that can take pictures of the whole body</li>
<li>Machines that have many small detectors</li>
</ul>
<p>This text is about a rule for testing machines that use radiation to make pictures of the body. These machines are called <strong>gamma cameras</strong><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>. The text tells what kinds of machines are in the rule and what kinds are not. It also tells why and how the rule was changed in 2007. The text says that some tests are more important than others, but it does not say which ones.</p>
<p>This text is about a way to check how well gamma cameras work. Gamma cameras are machines that take pictures of the inside of the body using special rays. The way to check them has four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 2: checks how well the machine can see the rays</li>
<li>Part 3: checks how well the machine can make flat pictures</li>
<li>Part 4: checks how well the machine can make 3D pictures</li>
<li>Part 5: checks how well the machine can make pictures of the whole body</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to check them is for both kinds of machines: ones that have smooth screens and ones that have tiny squares. Some things were changed from the old way to check them, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking out one thing to test with (2.5 How the machine is lined up)</li>
<li>Saying that the front of the part that catches the rays is what you can see</li>
<li>Saying what is the best way to set up the machine for different kinds of rays and how many rays it can handle</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changes"><a class="header" href="#changes">Changes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>The way the camera works and how much radiation it uses may change depending on the right way to use it for each patient.</li>
<li>The name &quot;scintillation camera&quot; was changed to &quot;gamma camera&quot; because there are new kinds of cameras that use different things to detect radiation.</li>
<li>Some mistakes were fixed and some pictures were added to make the text easier to understand.</li>

<p>This text is about how to check how good a camera is at seeing small things. The camera uses a special kind of light that can go through the body. This light is called radiation.</p>
<p>The text tells us how to do two tests. The first test is to see how clear the camera can show thin lines. The test uses a metal that makes radiation and a piece of metal with lines on it. The camera should not see too much radiation from the metal.</p>
<p>The second test is to see how well the camera can show different parts of the body. The test uses another piece of metal with holes on it. The camera should see the same amount of light from each hole.</p>
<p>The text also tells us how to measure the results of the tests. We use a number called FWHM or FWTM to measure how clear the image is. FWHM means full width at half maximum and FWTM means full width at tenth maximum<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>. These numbers tell us how far apart two points are on a curve that shows how bright the image is. The smaller the numbers, the clearer the image.</p>
<p>The text shows us two pictures of the pieces of metal and the curve.</p>
<p>The text explains how to measure the width and center of some curves that show the intensity of light coming through slits. The steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the digital resolution is good enough.</li>
<li>Find the highest point of each curve by estimating between the points you have.</li>
<li>Find four points on each curve that are half and one-tenth of the highest point (see Figure 2-3).</li>
<li>Subtract the points to get the width of each curve at half and one-tenth of the highest point. This is called FWHM and FWTM<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Find the middle point of each curve by averaging the points at half of the highest point. This is called E and it helps to find how straight the curve is.</li>
<li>Find the average distance between the curves over the whole area. This should be 30 mm, which is how far apart the slits are.</li>
<li>Use this distance to change FWHM and FWTM from channels to millimeters per channel.</li>
<li>Find the average FWHM and FWTM for both directions within the area.</li>
<li>Do not adjust for background or slit width.</li>
</ul>
<p>This text is about testing a camera that can see a special kind of metal that gives off energy. The metal is called Tc-99m and it is used by doctors to check people's health <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup>. The camera has a metal cover with small holes that lets some energy through. Behind the cover, there is a glass that glows when it gets energy. The camera can make pictures of the glowing glass.</p>
<p>The text tells how to check if the camera works well. It tells how to measure two things: how big and clear the pictures are, and how accurate the pictures are. It also tells how to set up the camera and the metal for the tests. The metal should be protected from other things that give off energy and it should have a certain amount of energy. The camera should be set to only see the energy from the metal and not get too much energy at once.</p>
<p>The steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add up the values along each line for both directions. Get data for each direction.</li>
<li>Find how far apart the tops of each line are and get the average.</li>
<li>Find how much the tops move from where they should be. This is called how much the lines shift<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>. Do this for both directions and get the average. Do this for two areas: UFOV and CFOV.</li>
<li>Find the best way to draw a grid of straight lines that match the data. This is called how much the lines bend<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup>. Do this for both directions and for both areas. Find the biggest difference between the data and the grid in pixels.</li>
<li>Change the results to millimeters using a number that makes them match.</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1^"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>How much the lines shift is how much the picture of a line is different from where it really is without a lens <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>.

<li>The text is about how to check and tell the quality of a gamma camera.</li>
<li>A gamma camera is a device that makes pictures of radioactive things inside the body <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Quality means how good the camera can show where and how much radioactive things are in the body. There are two ways to measure quality: spatial linearity and energy resolution.</li>
<li>Spatial linearity means how close the camera can show the real location of a radioactive thing. There are two kinds of spatial linearity: differential and absolute. Both kinds should be told for the UFOV (the whole area that the camera can see) and CFOV (the middle area that the camera can see) in millimeters.</li>
<li>Energy resolution means how close the camera can show the real energy of a radioactive ray. It should be told as a percentage of how wide the peak is compared to how high the peak is. The test uses Tc-99m as the radioactive thing and a copper shield and a lead mask to cover the camera.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-equipment"><a class="header" href="#test-equipment">Test Equipment</a></h2>
<p>The test equipment should have a way to measure the energy with many levels (at least 10,000) and a high accuracy (less than or equal to 0.05 FWHM) of Tc-99m peak.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-measure"><a class="header" href="#how-to-measure">How to Measure</a></h3>
<p>Use a small dot of Tc-99m that is far from the detector. Use another dot of Co-57 to find out how much energy each channel has. Save the spectra for Tc-99m and Co-57 separately. Add up the spectra from all pixels for each dot after fixing the energy and before finding the FWHM<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>. There should be at least 10,000 counts in the highest channel of each added spectrum.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-calculate-and-analyze"><a class="header" href="#how-to-calculate-and-analyze">How to Calculate and Analyze</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the middle of the half height channel values for each peak (see Figure 2-3).</li>
<li>The difference between the two peaks should be 18.4 keV.</li>
<li>Find the energy resolution from the Tc-99m peak.</li>
<li>Use Co-57 as the reference dot for calibration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-report"><a class="header" href="#how-to-report">How to Report</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Report the energy resolution for Tc-99m as a percentage.</li>
<li>Report any other dots separately.</li>

<p>This text tells you how to check if a system can see radiation from one point without a device that makes the beams straight. A device like this is called a collimator. You can measure how even the system sees the radiation in two ways: integral uniformity and differential uniformity. The text also has some rules for the test, like what kind of radiation, how much radiation, and what energy settings to use. The text is for cameras that have small squares in the image. Sometimes you need to add some squares together to get the right size. If the system has a collimator that you cannot change or cannot get the right size, you should say this with the result.</p>
<p>You need a holder for the source, a lead hole, and a computer. The holder is a lead cover with a hole in front. The lead hole fits the detector. Look at Figure 2-1.</p>
<p>Put the lead hole on the detector. Put the source in the holder on the same line as the detector. The distance should be at least five times the UFOV size. Save the image in a matrix with square pixels of 6.4 mm (+/- 30%). Get at least 10,000 counts in the middle pixel.</p>
<p>This is how to check if a gamma camera works well. A gamma camera is a machine that makes pictures of radioactive things inside the body<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, pick the pixels that are mostly inside the image area. Pixels are small dots that make up the image.</li>
<li>Then, get rid of the pixels that are too dark or have zero neighbors. Neighbors are pixels that touch each other. The pixels that are left are the ones to use for the image area analysis.</li>
<li>Next, make the image smoother by mixing each pixel with its neighbors. Use this table to decide how much to mix each neighbor:</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<ul>
<li>After that, find the brightest and darkest pixels in the image area. See how different they are by using this formula:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Integral Uniformity  = ±100 x (max - min) / (max + min)</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, find the biggest difference between any five pixels next to each other in a row or column. See how different they are by using the same formula as before:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Differential Uniformity = ±100 x (max - min) / (max + min)</code></p>
<p>This text is about how to check if a gamma camera works well. There are two ways to check it: integral uniformity and differential uniformity. Integral uniformity means how even the camera sees the radiation across the whole image. Differential uniformity means how much the camera sees the radiation in small parts of the image. Both values should be less than 2.5% for a good camera<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We want to check how good a gamma camera is. A gamma camera makes images of radiation. We need a small thing that gives off radiation and can cover the whole camera. We can use Tc-99m or Co-57<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup>. They are different kinds of radiation. We also need something that makes the radiation more clear. This is called a collimator.</p>
<p>We split the image into parts. We look at five parts at a time and find the most and least radiation. We use these numbers to find the difference between them. This is called differential uniformity. We do this for all the parts in each row and column. We find the biggest difference in each row and column. We also find the average difference for the whole image. This is called integral uniformity.</p>
<p>We write down the results for each kind of radiation. We write down both the average and the biggest difference for two areas: CFOV and UFOV. CFOV is the middle area of the image. UFOV is the whole image.</p>
<p>Another way to check how good a gamma camera is MWSR. MWSR means how well the camera can see different kinds of radiation with different energies. We need Ga-67, which has three kinds of radiation with different energies<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>. We need a special thing that holds Ga-67 and has nine holes in it<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4^">4</a></sup>. We put Ga-67 in front of the camera and make images with different energies. We see how much the images move from each other at each hole. The images should not move too much for a good camera.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-test-the-cameras-energy-window"><a class="header" href="#how-to-test-the-cameras-energy-window">How to test the camera's energy window</a></h1>
<p>An energy window is a range of energies that a camera can detect. A camera can have different energy windows for different types of radiation. To test the camera's energy window, you need to use a special source of radiation that has a hole in it. This source is called Ga-67<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5^">5</a></sup>. It is a type of radioactive material that emits photons with different energies.</p>
<p>To test the camera's energy window, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a special source of Ga-67 that has a hole in it (see Figure 2-4). The hole lets you see where the source is on the camera.</li>
<li>Put the source at nine points on the camera's front surface. This will cover the whole area of the camera.</li>
<li>Take pictures of the source through different energy windows. You can change the energy window by adjusting the settings on the camera. You need to take pictures through the energy windows that match the Ga-67 peaks. The peaks are the energies that Ga-67 emits most often.</li>
<li>Use the smallest pixels you can. Pixels are the tiny dots that make up a picture. The smaller the pixels, the clearer the picture.</li>
<li>Use the energy windows that match the Ga-67 peaks. The peaks are 93 keV, 184 keV, and 296 keV<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup>. These are the energies that Ga-67 emits most often. You can find these peaks on a graph called a spectrum.</li>
<li>Get at least 1,000 counts in the brightest pixel of each picture. Counts are how many photons hit a pixel. The brighter the pixel, the more counts it has. You need at least 1,000 counts to make sure that you have enough data for each picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, you can test the camera's energy window and see how well it detects Ga-67 radiation.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-check-a-gamma-camera"><a class="header" href="#how-to-check-a-gamma-camera">How to check a gamma camera</a></h1>
<p>A gamma camera is a machine that can see gamma rays from things that are radioactive. Gamma rays are a kind of invisible light. Doctors can use a gamma camera to look inside your body or for other reasons. To check if a gamma camera works well, we need to look at two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to find the center and number of counts for each picture</li>
<li>How to use a square area around the brightest spot to look at each picture</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-find-the-center-and-number-of-counts-for-each-picture"><a class="header" href="#how-to-find-the-center-and-number-of-counts-for-each-picture">How to find the center and number of counts for each picture</a></h2>
<p>A picture from a gamma camera shows different colors for different energy levels. Energy levels are how strong the gamma rays are. A peak in the picture is a spot with a lot of counts for one energy level. Counts are how many gamma rays the camera sees. We want to find the center of each peak in the picture. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a square area that is big enough to cover the peak. The peak should be half as tall at the edges of the square as it is in the middle.</li>
<li>Add up the counts along one side of the square to get a line of counts. Do this for both sides of the square.</li>
<li>Find the spot with the most counts in each line. This is the highest count spot.</li>
<li>Find the average of the spots and their counts. Use an odd number of spots around the highest count spot for this. The average is called the center of counts.</li>
<li>Do this for each peak and find the biggest difference in the centers of counts. Change this difference to millimeters using a number that tells you how big one spot is.</li>
</ul>

<li>Find the spot with the most counts in the whole picture. This is the brightest spot.</li>
<li>Pick a square area around this spot that is big enough to see what you want.</li>
<li>Look at how many counts are in each spot in the square area. You can also look at how they change over time or with different energy levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this summary is clear and helpful. If you need more information or examples, please let me know.😊
I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.🙏
Here is a paraphrased version of your text using simple English words and grammar:</p>
<p>To find out how accurate the position is</p>
<p>We use nine energy windows for this test. An energy window is how much energy the gamma rays have that the camera can see. We also use a point source that makes gamma rays with different energies.</p>
<p>We put the point source in nine places on a grid, like in Figure 2-5. For each place, we count how many X and Y spots the camera sees. We use a formula to find out how much the position moves when we use different energy windows. The movement is how much the position changes when we change the energy window. The biggest movement is the most movement we get.</p>
<p>We tell the biggest movement in X and Y ways in millimeters.</p>
<p>How to check how well a camera can detect gamma rays</p>
<p>We want to see how many gamma rays the camera can detect from a source that gets weaker over time. Gamma rays are high-energy rays that come from radioactive sources. Sometimes gamma rays hit other things and change their direction or energy. This is called scatter. We don't want scatter because it makes the camera less accurate.</p>
<p>We measure two things for different source strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many gamma rays the camera detects. This is called the observed count rate.</li>
<li>How many gamma rays the source sends out. This is called the input count rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We make a graph of the observed count rate and the input count rate.</p>
<p>We get two numbers from this graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>The observed count rate when the camera misses one out of every five gamma rays. This is called a 20% count loss.</li>
<li>The highest observed count rate that the camera can reach. This is called the maximum count rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-you-need"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need">What you need</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A source of Tc-99m. This is a common radioactive material that makes gamma rays. You can use another source but you have to say what it is.</li>
<li>A setting that matches the source and how you use the camera. Don't change this setting after you start.</li>
<li>A camera with only the useful part of the crystal showing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-find-out-how-strong-soil-is-using-tc-99m"><a class="header" href="#how-to-find-out-how-strong-soil-is-using-tc-99m">How to Find Out How Strong Soil Is Using Tc-99m</a></h1>
<p>Tc-99m is a metal that breaks down over time and sends out radio waves. You can use it to find out how strong soil is. This is called OCR (overconsolidation ratio). Here are the steps to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you need to measure the background noise. This is how many radio waves are in the air without Tc-99m. You need to do this at the start and at the end of the test. You can use a device called a detector to measure it. You need to measure for 100,000 times or 10 minutes, whichever is longer.</li>
<li>Next, you need to put Tc-99m in a thing that holds it. This is called a source holder. You need to put the source holder in front of the detector. Make sure the radio waves from Tc-99m go into the middle of the detector and cover it well. Be careful of radio waves that bounce off other things.</li>
<li>Then, you need to record some things. You need to record when you start and how long you measure for each time. You also need to record how many times the detector detects something. This is called counts. You need to start counting from the first time you measure. You need to measure for at least 100,000 times or 10 seconds, whichever is longer.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to calculate how strong the soil is. This is called OCR. To do this, you need to do some math. You need to subtract the background noise from the counts for each time you measure. Then you need to use a formula that involves how long it takes for half of Tc-99m to break down. This is called half-life.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how you find out how strong soil is using Tc-99m.</p>
<p>The text is about how to count the radiation from a substance without the noise from other sources. It also talks about how to fix the problem of losing counts when the detector is busy. It gives some formulas and numbers for doing this. It also gives a quicker way to do this test with metal sheets. Here is a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The substance is called Tc-99m and it is used for scanning different parts of the body<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The counts (C) are how many times the detector picks up the radiation from Tc-99m in a certain time (T).</li>
<li>The half-life (T_half) of Tc-99m is how long it takes for half of Tc-99m to disappear<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4^">4</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The output count rate (OCR) is how many counts per second the detector gets from Tc-99m.</li>
<li>The input count rate (ICR) is how many counts per second the detector would get from Tc-99m if there was no noise or loss.</li>
<li>The first formula uses C, T and T_half to find OCR. It assumes that Tc-99m does not change much during the measurement.</li>
<li>The second formula uses OCR at the end of the measurement (OCR_n), the time at the end (t_n) and the time at each data point (t_i) to find ICR. It corrects for the change of Tc-99m during the measurement.</li>
<li>The third formula uses ICR to find OCR at 20% loss (L_i). This is when the detector misses 20% of the counts because it is busy with other counts.</li>
<li>The text also has a picture that shows a graph of OCR versus time. It shows how OCR goes down as time goes by and Tc-99m disappears. It also shows how OCR at 20% loss is lower than OCR at each data point.</li>
</ul>

<li>Take a small sample across and along the tube. The sample should have at least 10,000 counts in the highest point.</li>
<li>Do this for all the tubes in the CFOV, first on the X line and then on the Y line.</li>
<li>Use Section 2.1.4 to work out the FWHM and FWTM in pixels and the calibration factor.</li>
<li>If you don't have the calibration factor, you can use another tube 100 mm from and next to the first one for each line.</li>

<li>An imaging system. This is a device that can take pictures of the radioactivity inside the phantom. It can count how many times it sees radioactivity in a certain area. This is called the number of counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>To test how good the detector is, you need to do these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure the activity in the syringe before you put it in the phantom. Write down this number and the time you measured it. This is called the original activity.</li>
<li>Put the syringe in the phantom and place it on the detector. Make sure it is in the middle and 10 mm away from it. Do not use anything else around it that can affect the radioactivity.</li>
<li>Use the imaging system to take a picture of the radioactivity in the phantom. Make sure you get at least 4 million counts. Do not change anything in the imaging system that can affect the counts. Write down when you started and how long you took the picture.</li>
<li>Measure the activity in the syringe after you took it out of the phantom. Subtract this number from the original activity. This gives you the activity in the phantom.</li>
<li>Draw a circle around the area where you see most of the radioactivity in the picture. This is called the region of interest (ROI). Count how many times you see radioactivity in this circle. This is called the ROI counts.</li>
<li>Use a formula to correct the ROI counts for decay over time.

<p>To test how well a detector can find radioactivity, you need these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fake object that has a known amount of radioactivity</li>
<li>A device that blocks rays that you don't want</li>
<li>A tool that measures how far the detector is from the fake object</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-measure-collimator-penetration"><a class="header" href="#how-to-measure-collimator-penetration">How to measure collimator penetration</a></h1>
<p>Collimator penetration is when some rays go through the collimator instead of being blocked by it. This can affect the quality of the image. To measure collimator penetration, you need to do these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put a phantom (a fake object that looks like a real one) 100 mm away from the detector and take an image.</li>
<li>Count how many counts (how many times the detector detects a ray) you get in the image and correct for decay (how the rays get weaker over time).</li>
<li>Divide the corrected count rate (how many counts per second) by the radioactivity (how many rays per second) in the phantom. This is the total system sensitivity (how well the system can detect rays).</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for different distances and make a graph of count rate vs distance.</li>
<li>Fit an exponential curve (a curve that goes up or down very fast) to the graph using Equation 3-2. The curve shows how much collimator penetration there is.</li>
<li>Calculate the collimator penetration fraction at 100 mm using Equation 3-3. This is how much of the count rate comes from rays that go through the collimator.</li>
</ol>

<p>DETECTOR SHIELDING
This test checks how good the gamma camera detector is at blocking radiation from outside the area it is looking at. This radiation can come from the patient or from other things nearby. The detector blocking should be as good as or better than the standard.</p>
<p>Note: This test is for cameras with separate pixels.</p>
<p>How to Test a Camera with Small Pixels</p>
<p>This article is about how to test a camera that can capture light from small parts of an image<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup>. The test uses a thing that makes radiation and another thing called a collimator that makes the radiation go in one direction. The test counts how much radiation the camera can see from different places of the thing that makes radiation. The test does this with two kinds of radiation: one called Tc-99m and another one that has more energy. The test also changes the camera and the collimator for each kind of radiation.</p>

<p>The article tells you how to test if the camera is protected from extra current or radiation. This is called shield leakage<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3^">3</a></sup>. The article gives three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>To test shield leakage, you need to put the thing that makes radiation inside the thing that protects the camera and count the radiation outside it. The count should be more than 10,000 for each time you measure. You also need to count the radiation without the thing that makes radiation.</li>
<li>To check if the thing that protects the camera works for other things that make radiation, you need to put one of them two meters away from the camera and count the radiation at four different places around the camera. The thing that makes radiation should point at the camera and cover it all. You need to write down the count and time for each place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some cameras can see heat or radiation. They are called <strong>thermal cameras</strong> or <strong>radiation cameras</strong><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1^">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2^">2</a></sup>. They can help us find things that are hot or radioactive. We need to test them to make sure they work well.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-test-the-shield"><a class="header" href="#how-to-test-the-shield">How to Test the Shield</a></h2>
<p>The shield is a metal cover that blocks some radiation. We want to know how much radiation can go through the shield.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put a thing that makes radiation near the camera. Move it to different places and write down how many radiation particles the camera sees.</li>
<li>The camera also sees some radiation from the air or other things. This is called <strong>background radiation</strong>. Take away the thing that makes radiation and write down how many radiation particles the camera sees. This is the background radiation.</li>
<li>For each place, take away the background radiation from the radiation that the camera saw. This is how much radiation came through the shield.</li>
<li>To find out how much radiation came through the shield as a percentage, use these formulas:</li>

<ul>
<li>Find the highest percentage for each place. Do not count the percentages when the camera was facing the thing that makes radiation.</li>
<li>Write down the highest percentages for each type of radiation. Also write down which <strong>collimator</strong> you used. The collimator is a part that changes how the camera sees radiation. The percentages should be lower than what the maker of the camera says.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-test-the-camera-with-scatter"><a class="header" href="#how-to-test-the-camera-with-scatter">How to Test the Camera with Scatter</a></h2>
<p>Scatter is when radiation bounces off something and changes direction. We want to know how well the camera can see scatter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Tc-99m or another type of radiation that makes scatter. Use the settings that the maker of the camera says. Do not change anything while you test.</li>
</ul>
<p>This text is about some ways to test machines that make pictures of radioactive things inside the body. These machines are called gamma cameras. They have detectors that catch gamma rays from radioisotopes. Radioisotopes are things that give off radiation. They can be put into the body by eating or injecting them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first way to test a gamma camera is to see how fast it counts the gamma rays from a round thing with water and radioisotopes. You need to use a special device that blocks some of the gamma rays. You also need to use a plastic tube with water or plastic inside. You need to put the round thing in the tube and the camera near the bottom of the tube. You need to write down how much radiation is around you and how long it takes to count the gamma rays.</li>
<li>The second way to test a gamma camera is to show the results of the counting. You need to use some math formulas to calculate the count rate. You also need to make a graph of the count rate with and without the special device. The graph shows how much scatter there is. Scatter is when gamma rays go in different directions and make the picture blurry.</li>
<li>The third way to test a gamma camera is to see how well it lines up the pictures from different angles. You need to use three small and round things with radioisotopes. You need to put them like in a picture. You also need to use high-resolution devices that measure how strong they are.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-test-equipment"><a class="header" href="#how-to-test-equipment">How to Test Equipment</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You need three small and round things that give off radiation. Put them like in Figure 4-1.</li>
<li>The things should have the same strength. Use tools that can measure them very well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-measure-things"><a class="header" href="#how-to-measure-things">How to Measure Things</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the things on a table. The middle one should be in the center of what you can see.</li>
<li>The tools that measure should be 20 cm from the center. You can use a machine that can move them for you.</li>
<li>The size of each dot should be less than 5 mm.</li>
<li>Take pictures at different angles. You need at least eight pictures.</li>
